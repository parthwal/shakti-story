            Our vision is to create a world where everyone is aware of the challenges and obstacles faced by women, 
            and where gender equity is the norm. We envision a society where women are treated with respect and dignity. 
            Through our website, we would like to educate young girls about the harassment they might face on the street, 
            and how they should react to the situation. We would like to empower women through education, advocacy, and 
            community building to create a culture where women are valued and celebrated.
